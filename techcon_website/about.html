<div class="mission-box">
<p>TechCon started in 1989 as a small student-led tech meetup in a university basement. <br>
    By the mid-1990s, it grew into an annual convention called “TechCon,” attracting hobbyists, <br>
    startups, and local companies. In the 2000s, it became a regional hub for technology innovation,<br>
    introducing tracks on web development, cybersecurity, and mobile computing. By the 2010s, TechCon went global,<br>
    featuring international speakers, live-streamed keynotes, and discussions on AI, robotics, and digital ethics.<br>
     Today, it is a major forum connecting innovators, entrepreneurs, and tech enthusiasts worldwide</p>
